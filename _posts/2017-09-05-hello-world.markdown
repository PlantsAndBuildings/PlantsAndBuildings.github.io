I am a programmer, bookworm, heavy metal afficionado and occasional short story writer. This blog right here is my miniscule attempt to share all that with any person who can spare the time to read it.

I am currently pursuing my final year of a Computer Science degree at Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, India. As such, I plan to write frequently on technical subjects - mainly my own readings, pet projects and multitudinous other forays into Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I also plan to write about the courses I am pursuing currently - so posts on abstract algebra, topology and statistical inference may also turn up quite a bit (atleast for now). Lastly, I plan to write about anything under the sun that catches my fancy.

I wish the reader of this blog the very best and hope that my convoluted ramblings do not cause him any stack corruptions.

Cheers,\\
Daivik
